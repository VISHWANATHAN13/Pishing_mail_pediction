# Phishing Mail Detection Project

## Overview:
This project is centered around creating a machine learning model to identify and classify phishing emails accurately. The model aims to detect characteristics and patterns typical of phishing emails to enhance email security.

## Project Components:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathering a diverse dataset of emails containing both legitimate and phishing examples.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extracting relevant features from the email content, headers, and attachments to distinguish phishing emails.
3. **Model Development:** Building machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting to predict phishing emails.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
5. **Deployment:** Implementing the trained model for real-time phishing email detection.

## Included Files:
- **emails_dataset.csv:** Dataset comprising email samples labeled as legitimate or phishing.
- **data_preprocessing.py:** Python script for cleaning and preparing the email dataset.
- **feature_extraction.py:** Code for extracting features from email content and headers.
- **model_training.py:** Script for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **prediction_app.py:** Application for predicting if an email is a phishing attempt.

## Instructions:
1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed on your system.
2. Run data_preprocessing.py to clean and preprocess the email dataset.
3. Execute feature_extraction.py to extract pertinent features from the emails.
4. Run model_training.py to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
5. Use prediction_app.py to classify new emails as legitimate or phishing.
